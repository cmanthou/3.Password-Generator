# 3.Password-Generator

When selecting GENERATE PASSWORD a series of prompts are generated to allow the user to costomize thier password based on length (btwn 8 and 128 characters), the case of alpha characters, numbers and special characters.  Based on the answers to the prompts a password is generated using any or all of the previously mentioned criteria.

Notes:
I am having trouble executing the Loop if no alpha numberic characters are selected as parameters (Cancels for all of the prompts except length).  The prompt displays correctly, but a password is still generated to the determined length with all parameters as true.
